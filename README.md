# Macro Project for Psychology Research Study

## Introduction

Welcome to my Macro Development Project at LeBow College of Business. This project involves developing automation macros and compiled single exe files to streamline operations and reduce manual data processing by a significant margin. I am transitioning legacy scripts to Python for enhanced reliability and automation, aligning the project with departmental objectives.

## Project Components

The project is divided into four key components, each targeting a specific area of research operation automation:

1. **RPC Macro**: Sets up remote communication and command execution.
2. **Automation Macro**: Manages the automated handling of software and survey tools.
3. **Performance Metric Macro**: Automates the collection and processing of performance data.
4. **LOG Extractor Macro**: Archives mission logs in an organized and efficient manner.

## Current Status

### RPC Macro

- **Purpose**: Enables communication between the experimenter's and participant's PCs to invoke other macros.
- **Status**: On hold. Basic functionality implemented but requires updates for specific commands.

### Automation Macro

- **Purpose**: Automates the opening, closing, and configuration of various tools for the research process.
- **Status**: On hold. Halfway through development; needs integration of direct readings from the participant's computer.

### Performance Metric Macro

- **Purpose**: Facilitates the migration of data processing functions from Perl scripts, aiming to output data to Excel for analysis.
- **Status**: Completed and tested. Working as intended, generates Excel file and includes it in LOG extractor.

### LOG Extractor Macro

- **Purpose**: Organizes and stores mission log files in a zip format for future reference.
- **Status**: Completed and tested. Working as intended and fulfilling its logging and archiving role.

## Next Steps

Integrate all macros together through the overall project workflow for streamlined operation.
