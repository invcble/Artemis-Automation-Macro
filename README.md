# Macro Project for Behavioural Research Study

## Introduction

Welcome to my Macro Development Project at the LeBow College of Business, a earnest effort to automate and streamline the operational aspects of behavioral research studies. This project involves developing a suite of Python-based automation tools that work together seamlessly to ensure efficient data collection and processing. The project leverages a custom-built Tkinter GUI to provide an intuitive control panel for experimenters.

## Project Overview

The Macro Development Project integrates automation tools into a single executable, reducing manual processes and enhancing data integrity throughout the research lifecycle. The project's components include:

1. **Research Control Panel** (`Ctrl_Experimenter_NEW.py`):
   - A user-friendly GUI control panel built with Tkinter that allows experimenters to input team IDs and manage research sessions.

2. **Session Management Tools**:
   - Scripts for starting and stopping research sessions and simulations (`Start_Artemis_M*.py`, `Stop_Artemis.py`).

3. **Data Capture Utilities**:
   - Tools for taking timed screenshots and handling survey data (`Take_Screenshot*.py`, `Start_Survey*.py`).

4. **Logistics and Archiving Features**:
   - Macros for organizing and archiving mission logs (`move_log_E.py`) and video recordings (`move_video_P.py`).

5. **Performance Metrics and Training**:
   - Automation of performance metrics collection (`Start_Recording_P.py`, `Stop_Recording_P.py`) and setting up training sessions (`Start_Training_P.py`).

## Advanced Features

The control panel integrates XML-RPC clients to communicate with remote stations during experiments. It handles complex operations such as:

- Verifying connections to participant stations.
- Running parallel tasks using threading to coordinate between different experiment phases.
- Starting and stopping recording sessions and simulations across multiple systems.

## Future Directions

As I continue to develop this project, the immediate goals include:

- **Integration**: Combining all tools into a cohesive and unified system.
- **Enhancement**: Refining scripts for greater resilience and scalability.
- **Usability**: Ensuring the GUI is intuitive and accessible for all experimenters.
