# Macro Project for Behavioural Research Study

## Introduction

Welcome to my Macro Development Project at LeBow College of Business. This project involves developing automation macros and compiled single exe files to streamline operations and reduce manual data processing by a significant margin. I am transitioning legacy scripts to Python for enhanced reliability and automation, aligning the project with departmental objectives.

## Project Components

The project is divided into four key components, each targeting a specific area of research operation automation:

1. **RPC Macro**: Enables communication between the experimenter's and participant's PCs to invoke other macros.
2. **Automation Macro**: Automates the opening, closing, and configuration of various tools (Artemis, screenshots, surveys) for the experiment.
3. **Performance Metric Macro**: Automates the collection and processing of performance data to excel sheet.
4. **LOG Extractor Macro**: Archives mission logs in an organized and efficient manner.

## Next Steps

Integrate all macros together through the overall project workflow for streamlined operation.
